## Description
This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a **Devour It!** button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. **More Details to Come!**
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Installation
Clone this repo to your local macine, navigate to the Burger folder and run ```nmp install``` to get the dependencies. This requires **MySQL** to run database.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Usage
More details soon.
