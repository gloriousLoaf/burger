## Description
This is a restaurant-inspired app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a *Devour It* button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. All burgers will remain in the database, whether eaten or not.

## Installation
Clone this repo to your local machine, navigate to the Burger folder and run ```npm install``` to get the dependencies. This requires knowledge of **MySQL** or other SQL database to run.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Usage
**Running this app locally:** Get MySQL database running (connection.js is set to default 3306), and navigate to the **burger** directory in your command line. Run ```node server``` to connect. Navigate to **localhost:3000** in your browser and start cooking up some burgers. Figuratively, that is. If your machine can cook burgers, you should invest in a better cooling system for your processors.

**Heroku Deployment:** Checkout [JawsDB](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/jawsdb) to set up your own hosted instance. Also give the app a try at my deployment on [Heroku](https://maple-whistler-67367.herokuapp.com/).
